# Proposal Format

<em>This is still being discussed, but we are using this format until we
either adopt it or make something better for us.</em>


1. Proposals should be for one major project at a time, so that each may be 
considered on its own merits. No throwing everything at the wall to see what 
sticks. LLC members generally want to say yes to projects. It’s not fair to 
them to combine a bunch of projects in one proposal so that none of the 
projects are considered properly on its own merits, but some get passed just 
because they don’t want to say no to everything.

2. If a major project is necessary for executing the overall project, you 
must show this clearly in your proposal. 
(Such as tilling extensively to grow a farm)

3. All project proposals should include an estimate of costs associated and 
suggestions on how to meet those costs.

4. All project proposals should include a supply list including both on hand 
supplies and supplies to be acquired.

5. If the project is a business, a traditional business plan should be included.

6. All projects should include a list of estimated labor, paid, volunteer, who, 
how many hours.

7. All projects must include a timeline. The timeline is suggestive and may not 
be followed precisely, but will give the LLC the sense that you have fully 
thought out the project trajectory.

8. All projects must undergo a question and answer / discussion period, length to 
be determined, to take place on Element, to the satisfaction of all LLC members.

9. Before final approval an oral question and answer session may be required, 
to take place in person or on Zoom.

10. Projects and support materials must be submitted in file formats that are 
easily readable such as pdf and jpg.
