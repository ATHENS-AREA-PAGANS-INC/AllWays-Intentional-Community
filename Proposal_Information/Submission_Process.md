# Submission Process 

<em>This is still being discussed, but we are using this procedure until we
either adopt it or make something better for us.</em>

## Prerequisites:  

You must join our:

1. Online communications platform 

2. Online file and data sharing platform

To learn how, send an email to allways@athensareapagans.org 
explaining what you want to do.

## Preliminary Proposal Procedure

It is a good idea to submit a preliminary proposal for these reasons:

* You can get a feel for whether your idea is going to be well received

* The feedback you get will give you some good ideas for what needs to 
go into your full proposal.

* You can avoid doing a lot of work making a full proposal that noone 
will like or making a full proposal that you will need to change a lot.

The process:

1. Generate your preliminary proposal.  This should be no more than, say,
500 words and no more than 5 figures (images, figures, etc.).  In the
proposal, very briefly describe what you have in mind.

2. Place your preliminary proposal in the `Preliminary_Proposals` 
sub-folder of the `AllWays_Proposals` folder in our online file 
sharing platform.

3. Announce your preliminary proposal in the Intentional Community room 
in our communications platform.  Preferably, also provide a link to your 
proposal file in your announcement.

## Full Proposal Procedure

1. Generate your proposal according to the Proposal Format.  You should find
the instructions in the same folder where you find this file.

2. Place your full proposal in the `Full_Proposal_Submissions` sub-folder of 
the `AllWays_Proposals` folder in our online file sharing platform.

3. Announce your full proposal in the Intentional Community room in our 
communications platform.  Preferably, also provide a link to your proposal
file in your announcement.
